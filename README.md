- **Frontend Developer Assignment Reference Document**
    
    ### Environment Setup
    
    1. **Node.js**: First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the Node.js official website.
    2. **React**: Set up your React application using Create React App for the frontend.
        - **Install Create React App globally** (optional):
            - `npm install -g create-react-app`
        - **Create a new React project**:
            - `npx create-react-app todo-app`
            - `cd todo-app`
    
    ### Frontend Development with React
    
    - **React Components**: Develop the application using class components.
        - **TaskInput Component**: A form that allows users to add a new task.
        - **TaskList Component**: Displays the list of tasks with options to delete and edit.
    - **State Management**
        - Use `this.state` to manage tasks.
        - Implement actions and reducers to handle state logic if using Redux.
    
    ### Functionality Requirements
    
    1. **Add Task**: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
    2. **View Tasks**: Display all added tasks in a list format.
    3. **Delete Task**: Each task should have a delete button to remove it from the list.
    4. **Edit Task**: Each task should have an edit button that, when clicked, allows the task to be edited.
    5. **Optional Features**:
        - Mark tasks as completed.
        - Save tasks to local storage to persist data on page reload.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
